== Introduction

=== Teams

==== Get a Collection of Teams

This endpoint allows for the retrieval of a collection of teams.

===== cURL Request

==== Create a Team

This endpoint allows for the creation of a new team.

===== cURL Request

include::{snippets}/create-a-team/curl-request.adoc[]

===== Request Fields

include::{snippets}/create-a-team/request-fields.adoc[]

Note that when creating a new team, an id _MUST NOT_ be sent with the request. A null value _MAY_ be sent (but not necessary). In the event an id _is_ sent, a client error response status will be sent back.

Upon sucessful creation, a `Location` header will be sent back, specifiying the newly created URI for the team.

==== Update a Team

Generally, the way to update a team, is to first retrieve the team representation from the server, update it on the client, then send back the updated representation.

===== Initial GET cURL Request

include::{snippets}/update-team-initial-get/curl-request.adoc[]

include::{snippets}/update-team-initial-get/http-response.adoc[]

Once the client has does an updates with the representation, and wants to push the changes to the server, a PUT request should be made

include::{snippets}/update-team/curl-request.adoc[]

In both the GET and the PUT request, the team identifier should be present

include::{snippets}/update-team/path-parameters.adoc[]

In the PUT request, the request field should match this URL identifier. A request with a different identifiers will lead to an error response. And a request using a nonexistant identifier will result in a 404 error response. It is for this reason, an initial GET for the representation should be made before making an update.

==== Delete a Team

This enpoint allows for the deletion of a team.

===== cURL Request

include::{snippets}/delete-team/curl-request.adoc[]

The team identifier should be present in the URL. If the team doesn't exist, a 404 response status will be returned.

include::{snippets}/delete-team/path-parameters.adoc[]

If the team is successfully deleted, a 200 response status will
be returned.
